## Prerequisites

Xcode 8.3.3

## Install Carthage

I'm using Carthage for using 3rd party libraries.

#You can download Carthage.pkg here : 
https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/releases

#Or you can use HomeBrew on your terminal ( Quickest way): 
First you need to install homebrew on your machine.
You can use this command : 
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)

and then :
brew install carthage 

## Open the Project 

Run in your Terminal the command : carthage update --platform iOS -no-use-binaries

After you just need to open ReignDesign.xcodeproj and you can run the project.
